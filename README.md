• Invitation to the test: we describe briefly the test, invite the participant, inform them about the terms of participation, especially about the use of data and the recordings, and give instructions to perform the test;
• Privacy Policy: the app’s privacy policy, which describes how data is used;
• Terms of Use: the app’s terms of use, which describes the conditions to use the app and the limitations of responsibilities;
• Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): the app’s FAQ, which describes the app and its works, especially about the emotion recognition mechanism, but also about the user experience evaluation model;
• Usability Test Script: a document with the presentation of the test, the think-aloud protocol recommendations, and the descriptions of four tasks. The tasks covered pre-execution in UXAPP, execution in the site to be tested, and pos-execution in UXAPP again. This document guided the participants through all the steps they should take.
